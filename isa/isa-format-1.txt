"c:" - indicates code/instructions in memory
"d:" - indicates data in memory

Code blocks are partitioned into sets of instructions separated by new-lines - each instruction is structured into 3 contiguous bytes in memory, the first is an instruction/opcode, then the next 2 bytes refer to a 16-bit memory address

Data blocks should be written one line after another for each consequent address

[c/d]:[START] - this indicates the initiation of either a code or data block at a start memory address. Code blocks must come before data blocks. You can only have one code block, and you can have multiple data blocks.
