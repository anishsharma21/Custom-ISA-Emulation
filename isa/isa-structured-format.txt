This is the "structured" format.

[c/d]:[START] - this indicates the initiation of either a code or data block at a start memory address. Code blocks must come before data blocks. You can only have one code block, and you can have multiple data blocks

"c:" - indicates code/instructions in memory to follow
"d:" - indicates data in memory to follow

Code blocks are partitioned into sets of instructions separated by new-lines - each instruction is structured into 3 contiguous bytes in memory, the first is an instruction/opcode, then the next 2 bytes refer to a 16-bit memory address. This makes it easy to distinguish between unique instructions.

Data blocks are just written with each newline denoting the byte value at that address following the starting address in order.

The following program is written in the "structured" format and adds two 8-bit numbers and then stores the sum in the address right after the two numbers. More examples can be found in the `programs` directory.
