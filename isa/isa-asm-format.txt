This is the "assembly (asm)" format.

[MNEMONIC] [DESTINATION].[SOURCE]

The opcode to mnemonic mappings can be found in the 'isa-instructions.txt' file. This is the standard assembly language format for direct memory manipulation. There is no need to structure instructions in 3 bytes - they are coded for by mnemonics and a consistent structure. 

Each program begins with the `BEGIN` keyword and ends with HLT (halt). 
Comments are prefixed with `//`. 
Newlines can be added between instructions if desired for better formatting.
[####h] - is an address location
##h - is hexademical representation of data (a byte of data)
